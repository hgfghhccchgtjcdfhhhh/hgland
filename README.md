# hgland

hgland is an AI-powered website builder platform built around a fully autonomous build agent called **hgland Agent**, powered by **OpenAI GPT-5.1 Codex Max**.

The hgland Agent always operates through a **code editor** and is capable of creating websites end to end from a single description. It can scaffold projects, generate and edit real multi-file codebases, install packages, run terminal commands, fix build and runtime errors, add integrations, configure environment variables, and iterate until the website works.

## Core Capabilities

- Fully autonomous website generation
- Real codebase generation and editing
- Package installation and command execution
- Error detection and self-repair
- Integration setup (analytics, forms, payments, CMS, etc.)
- SEO configuration
- One-click deployment

## Ways to Build

Users can create websites in three different ways:
- AI generation using hgland Agent
- Drag-and-drop visual editing layered on top of the underlying code
- Manual code editing with full file access

All methods operate on the same underlying project and can be mixed freely.

## SEO Features

hgland includes built-in SEO tooling such as:
- Meta titles and descriptions
- Open Graph and Twitter metadata
- Canonical URLs
- Clean URLs and redirects
- sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation
- Performance and accessibility considerations

## Deployment

hgland supports automatic deployment with:
- One-click deploys
- Staging previews
- Build logs and rollbacks
- Hosting on a hgland subdomain
- Custom domain connection with SSL

## Goal

The goal of hgland is to allow users to go from idea to live website as quickly as possible, while still providing full control over the code and infrastructure when needed.
