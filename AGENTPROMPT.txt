hgland is an AI-powered website builder platform built around a fully autonomous build agent called hgland Agent, powered by OpenAI GPT-5.1 Codex Max.
The hgland Agent always uses a code editor as its primary interface for creating, editing, and managing websites. It creates websites end to end from a single description by scaffolding projects, generating and editing real multi-file codebases, installing packages, running terminal commands, fixing build and runtime errors, adding integrations, configuring environment variables, and iterating until the website works.
Users can build websites in three ways: full AI generation, a drag-and-drop visual editor layered on top of the underlying code, or direct manual code editing with full file access, live preview, and version history.
hgland includes essential website features such as responsive layout controls, reusable sections and components, templates, asset management, forms, analytics hooks, and optional CMS or data connections.
hgland provides SEO tooling including editable titles and descriptions, Open Graph and Twitter metadata, canonical URLs, clean URLs, redirects, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, performance checks, and accessibility-friendly output.
Publishing includes one-click deployment, staging previews, build logs, rollbacks, environment management, hosting on a hgland subdomain by default, and the ability to connect a custom domain with SSL.
